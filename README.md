This project examined the causal effect of education on wages using instrumental variable (IV) analysis. Education was endogenous because unobserved ability affected both education and wages. To address this, near_college was used as an instrument, satisfying relevance (correlated with education) and exclusion (affecting wages only through education). Simulated data were explored to confirm these properties. A first-stage regression showed that the instrument was strong, with a high F-statistic. Second-stage and IV regressions were used to estimate the causal impact of education on wages. The results indicated a positive and statistically significant effect of education on wages. Comparisons with OLS coefficient magnitudes highlighted how IV methods corrected for endogeneity bias.
